# Errors
If Discord is not opened, or, for some reason, the RPC Client couldn't connect to it, an error will show in the app. It disappears in 15 seconds.
Even if Discord is not opened, you can still use the app as a normal Netflix wrapper.

# Things you should know
The app has support for all the 33 avatars available in Netflix, and shows in the Rich Presence (see previews).

# Planned
Netflix Party support so you and your friends can watch anything together (and show in the Rich Presence, obviously)
